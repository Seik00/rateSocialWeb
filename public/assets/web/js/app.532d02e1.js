About Digital Alpha Tokens; General Restrictions; Forks: Digital Alpha issues and redeems Digital Alpha Tokens. Digital Alpha Tokens may be used, kept, or exchanged online <br/> wherever parties are willing to accept Digital Alpha Tokens. Digital Alpha Tokens are 100% backed by by Digital Alpha\'s Reserves. Digital Alpha Tokens are denominated in a range <br/> of Fiat. For example, if you purchase EURT, your Digital Alpha Tokens are 1-to-1 pegged to Euros. If you cause to be issued EURT 100.00, Digital Alpha holds Reserves <br/> valued at €100.00 to back those Digital Alpha Tokens. The composition of the Reserves used to back Digital Alpha Tokens is within the sole control and at the sole <br/> and absolute discretion of Digital Alpha. Digital Alpha Tokens are backed by Digital Alpha\'s Reserves, including Fiat, but Digital Alpha Tokens are not Fiat themselves. Digital Alpha will <br/> not issue Digital Alpha Tokens for consideration consisting of the Digital Tokens (for example, bitcoin); only money will be accepted upon issuance. In order to <br/> cause Digital Alpha Tokens to be issued or redeemed directly by Digital Alpha, you must be a verified customer of Digital Alpha. No exceptions will be made to this <br/> provision. The right to have Digital Alpha Tokens redeemed or issued is a contractual right personal to you. Digital Alpha reserves the right to delay the redemption or <br/> withdrawal of Digital Alpha Tokens if such delay is necessitated by the illiquidity or unavailability or loss of any Reserves held by Digital Alpha to back the Digital Alpha <br/> Tokens, and Digital Alpha reserves the right to redeem Digital Alpha Tokens by in-kind redemptions of securities and other assets held in the Reserves. Digital Alpha makes <br/> no representations or warranties about whether Digital Alpha Tokens that may be traded on the Site may be traded on the Site at any point in the future, if at <br/> all. <br/> Digital Alpha Tokens are issued on various decentralized and open-source blockchains and protocols. Blockchains and protocols can sometimes experience <br/> events called \'forks\' where an alternative version of a blockchain or protocol is created. Where forks occur, it is possible that multiple versions of a Digital <br/> Token available on such blockchain or protocol could be created, for example, one on each fork. Due to the nature of Digital Alpha Tokens, if a fork creates two <br/> or more Digital Tokens which purport to be a Digital Alpha Token, it is only possible for one of those Digital Tokens to be a Digital Alpha Token. As a result, in the event <br/> of a fork only the Digital Tokens on the particular blockchain or protocol that Digital Alpha announces on its website as being supported by Digital Alpha are Digital Alpha <br/> Tokens. Any other Digital Tokens resulting from the fork are not Digital Alpha Tokens. <br/> Digital Alpha is under no obligation to support any particular blockchain or protocol, any forked version of any particular blockchain or protocol or any Digital <br/> Tokens resulting from a fork of a blockchain. Where a blockchain or protocol on which Digital Alpha Tokens are issued is forked, Digital Alpha may elect to suspend <br/> Services temporarily or for an extended period of time on little or no notice. Digital Alpha will determine, in its sole discretion, whether to support a particular <br/> fork of a blockchain or protocol or whether to cease support for all version of a particular blockchain or protocol. Where Digital Alpha determines to cease <br/> support for a particular blockchain or protocol, you will take any and all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the migration of your Digital Alpha Token to <br/> a supported blockchain or protocol identified by Digital Alpha. Digital Alpha assumes no liability or responsibility whatsoever arising out of or relating to your failure to <br/> effectuate such migration of your Digital Alpha Token to another blockchain or protocol identified by Digital Alpha. <br/> Digital Alpha assumes no liability or responsibility whatsoever for any losses or other issues that might arise from Digital Alpha electing to support or not support a <br/> particular blockchain or protocol, any forked version of any particular blockchain or protocol or any Digital Tokens resulting from a fork of a blockchain or <br/> protocol.</p></div>","LEGAL3":"<div class=\'d-flex\'> <p class=\'mb-1\'> It is also possible that a third-party could create a Digital Token which claims to be an alternative version of a Digital Alpha Token, such as by \'wrapping\' or <br/> \'bridging\' Digital Alpha Tokens. These Digital Tokens are not Digital Alpha Tokens. They are not issued or supported by Digital Alpha. They cannot be redeemed with Digital Alpha. <br/> The following Persons are prohibited from depositing to, or withdrawing from, any Digital Tokens Wallet on the Site: <br/> 3.1. Persons domiciled or ordinarily resident in, certain nationals of, or the Governments or Government Officials of Prohibited Jurisdictions; <br/> 3.2. any Person that resides, is located, has a place of business, or conducts business in the State of New York; <br/> 3.3.

Licence to Use the Site: If you comply with these Terms of Service, Digital Alpha grants you the limited right to use the Site and the Services. The right to use <br/> the Site and the Services is a personal, restricted, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited licence, and it is subject to the <br/> limitations and obligations in these Terms of Service. Nothing in these Terms of Service gives you any licence (other than as set out in this paragraph), <br/> right, title, or ownership of, in, or to the Site, any of the Services, the Copyrights or the Marks.

About Digital Alpha Tokens; General Restrictions; Forks: Digital Alpha issues and redeems Digital Alpha Tokens. Digital Alpha Tokens may be used, kept, or exchanged online <br/> wherever parties are willing to accept Digital Alpha Tokens. Digital Alpha Tokens are 100% backed by by Digital Alpha\'s Reserves. Digital Alpha Tokens are denominated in a range <br/> of Fiat. For example, if you purchase EURT, your Digital Alpha Tokens are 1-to-1 pegged to Euros. If you cause to be issued EURT 100.00, Digital Alpha holds Reserves <br/> valued at €100.00 to back those Digital Alpha Tokens. The composition of the Reserves used to back Digital Alpha Tokens is within the sole control and at the sole <br/> and absolute discretion of Digital Alpha. Digital Alpha Tokens are backed by Digital Alpha\'s Reserves, including Fiat, but Digital Alpha Tokens are not Fiat themselves. Digital Alpha will <br/> not issue Digital Alpha Tokens for consideration consisting of the Digital Tokens (for example, bitcoin); only money will be accepted upon issuance. In order to <br/> cause Digital Alpha Tokens to be issued or redeemed directly by Digital Alpha, you must be a verified customer of Digital Alpha. No exceptions will be made to this <br/> provision. The right to have Digital Alpha Tokens redeemed or issued is a contractual right personal to you. Digital Alpha reserves the right to delay the redemption or <br/> withdrawal of Digital Alpha Tokens if such delay is necessitated by the illiquidity or unavailability or loss of any Reserves held by Digital Alpha to back the Digital Alpha <br/> Tokens, and Digital Alpha reserves the right to redeem Digital Alpha Tokens by in-kind redemptions of securities and other assets held in the Reserves. Digital Alpha makes <br/> no representations or warranties about whether Digital Alpha Tokens that may be traded on the Site may be traded on the Site at any point in the future, if at <br/> all. <br/> Digital Alpha Tokens are issued on various decentralized and open-source blockchains and protocols. Blockchains and protocols can sometimes experience <br/> events called \'forks\' where an alternative version of a blockchain or protocol is created. Where forks occur, it is possible that multiple versions of a Digital <br/> Token available on such blockchain or protocol could be created, for example, one on each fork. Due to the nature of Digital Alpha Tokens, if a fork creates two <br/> or more Digital Tokens which purport to be a Digital Alpha Token, it is only possible for one of those Digital Tokens to be a Digital Alpha Token. As a result, in the event <br/> of a fork only the Digital Tokens on the particular blockchain or protocol that Digital Alpha announces on its website as being supported by Digital Alpha are Digital Alpha <br/> Tokens. Any other Digital Tokens resulting from the fork are not Digital Alpha Tokens. <br/> Digital Alpha is under no obligation to support any particular blockchain or protocol, any forked version of any particular blockchain or protocol or any Digital <br/> Tokens resulting from a fork of a blockchain. Where a blockchain or protocol on which Digital Alpha Tokens are issued is forked, Digital Alpha may elect to suspend <br/> Services temporarily or for an extended period of time on little or no notice. Digital Alpha will determine, in its sole discretion, whether to support a particular <br/> fork of a blockchain or protocol or whether to cease support for all version of a particular blockchain or protocol. Where Digital Alpha determines to cease <br/> support for a particular blockchain or protocol, you will take any and all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the migration of your Digital Alpha Token to <br/> a supported blockchain or protocol identified by Digital Alpha. Digital Alpha assumes no liability or responsibility whatsoever arising out of or relating to your failure to <br/> effectuate such migration of your Digital Alpha Token to another blockchain or protocol identified by Digital Alpha. <br/> Digital Alpha assumes no liability or responsibility whatsoever for any losses or other issues that might arise from Digital Alpha electing to support or not support a <br/> particular blockchain or protocol, any forked version of any particular blockchain or protocol or any Digital Tokens resulting from a fork of a blockchain or <br/> protocol.</p></div>","LEGAL3":"<div class=\'d-flex\'> <p class=\'mb-1\'> It is also possible that a third-party could create a Digital Token which claims to be an alternative version of a Digital Alpha Token, such as by \'wrapping\' or <br/> \'bridging\' Digital Alpha Tokens. These Digital Tokens are not Digital Alpha Tokens. They are not issued or supported by Digital Alpha. They cannot be redeemed with Digital Alpha. <br/> The following Persons are prohibited from depositing to, or withdrawing from, any Digital Tokens Wallet on the Site: <br/> 3.1.

You further acknowledge and agree that Digital Alpha is not liable for any losses or issues that may arise from third-party transactions, including, but not <br/> limited to, legality (including any consequences for illegal transactions that may be triggered under these Terms of Service), quality, delivery, or <br/> satisfaction with any products purchased by means of a Digital Token transfer. In the event that you are not satisfied with any goods or services <br/> purchased from, or sold to, a third party using the Services, you must handle those issues directly with the third-party seller or buyer, as applicable. <br/> Digital Tokens may be compatible with third-party software or other technology provided by a third party. Digital Alpha does not guarantee the security or <br/> functionality of third-party software or technology and is not liable for losses of Digital Tokens due to the failure or malfunction of third-party software or technology. <br/> 5. Withdrawals and Deposits: In the course of processing and sending any withdrawals, or when processing and receiving deposits, Digital Alpha may be required <br/> to share your user information with other contractual third parties, including financial institutions, or as required under applicable Laws or demanded <br/> upon a lawful request by any Government.

You accept all consequences of sending Digital Tokens, including Digital Alpha Tokens, off of the Site. <br/> Digital Token transactions are not reversible. Once you send Digital Tokens to an address, whether intentionally or by a fraudulent or accidental <br/> transaction, you accept the risk that you may lose access to, and any claim on, those Digital Tokens indefinitely or permanently. You acknowledge that <br/> Digital Alpha may delay or suspend redemption under various circumstances, including but not limited to, in the event that Digital Alpha determines that you have <br/> engaged in a Prohibited Use (as defined in paragraph 8); when Digital Alpha is directed to do so by any Government; if your Digital Tokens Wallet or other <br/> account or wallet is subject to pending litigation, investigation, or Government proceedings; or when Digital Alpha believes that someone is attempting to gain <br/> unauthorized access to your Digital Tokens Wallet or other account or wallet. Digital Tokens are not legal tender and are not backed by any Government. <br/> Digital Tokens are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\'FDIC) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. <br/> 6.

You and Digital Alpha agree that any Party hereto may bring claims <br/> against the others only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. No <br/> adjudicator may consolidate or join more than one Person\'s or party\'s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, <br/> representative, or class proceeding. Any relief awarded to any one Digital Alpha user cannot and may not affect any other Digital Alpha users. <br/> 6.2.

For claims less than $15,000, DATD shall reimburse you for all <br/> initiating filing fees that are in excess of fees you would have paid if you were proceeding in court, provided however, should you be deemed to be the <br/> losing Party, the filing fees reimbursed by DATD shall be added to the final arbitrator\'s costs and fees award. The prevailing Party shall be entitled to its <br/> costs of the arbitration (including the arbitrator\'s fees) and its reasonable attorney\'s fees and costs. You and Digital Alpha agree that any Party hereto may bring <br/> claims against the others only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. <br/> No class arbitration is permitted, and no arbitrator may consolidate or join more than one Person\'s or party\'s claims and may not otherwise preside over <br/> any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.
